class Solution(object):
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        candidate = None
        count = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
            
            if num == candidate:
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1
        
        return candidate

Complexity

✅ Time: O(n) → single loop
✅ Space: O(1) → no extra memory

🎯 Interview Explanation 

I use Boyer-Moore Voting. When count becomes zero, I pick a new candidate. Matching elements increase the vote, different elements decrease it. Since the majority element appears more than half the time, it cannot be completely cancelled.
