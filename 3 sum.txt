Time Complexity: O(n^2)  The for loop runs $n$ times, and the while loop (the pointers) also traverses the rest of the array ($n$ times).
Space Complexity: O(1) (if we don't count the output list and internal sorting space). We only use a few variables 


"I solve 3Sum in O(n^2) by sorting the array and using an anchor element with two pointers to find triplets. Because it's sorted, I can "pinch" the pointers—moving left to increase the sum or right to decrease it—to efficiently hit zero. To ensure unique results, I simply skip duplicate values for both the anchor and the pointers during the iteration.Time Complexity: O(n^2) Space Complexity: O(1) (ignoring output/sort space)."
