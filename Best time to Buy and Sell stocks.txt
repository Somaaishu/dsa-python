I track the minimum price while traversing the array.
For each day, I compute the profit and update the maximum profit.
This gives O(n) time and O(1) space.

Time: O(n) — single pass tracking min price

Space: O(1) — only two variables used

“I track the minimum price and maximum profit in one traversal.”
