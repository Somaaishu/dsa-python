class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_water = 0

            # Calculate current area: width * height of the shorter wall
            width = right - left
            current_height = min(height[left], height[right])
            current_area = width * current_height

            # Logic: Move the pointer pointing to the shorter wall
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
                
        return max_water

Time O(n) We traverse the array exactly once with the two pointers.
Space O(1) We only store a few variables (left, right, max_water).

"I used a Two-Pointer approach starting at both ends of the array to maximize the container's width initially. In each step, I calculated the area using the shorter wall as the height bottleneck and updated the global maximum. To find a potentially larger area despite the decreasing width, I greedily moved the pointer pointing to the shorter wall, searching for a taller boundary that could increase the overall volume."
