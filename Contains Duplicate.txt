I iterate through the array and store elements in a set.
If an element already exists in the set, I return true.
If the loop completes, there are no duplicates.
This solution runs in O(n) time.

Time: O(n) — single traversal, set lookup O(1)

Space: O(n) — set stores unique elements

“A set helps detect duplicates efficiently in one pass.”
